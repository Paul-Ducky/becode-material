## The Mission
This week you will create your own startup from concept to finish in small groups!

What are we going to make for this exercise?

This time you decide!

I cannot wait to see what you all will create!*

### Required features
The only requirement is to connect to *at least* one external API. You can do this with a backend or frontend language, or use a combination of both.

You can find a large collection free API's to use:
- https://www.programmableweb.com/category/all/apis
- https://rapidapi.com/
- https://medium.com/better-programming/a-curated-list-of-100-cool-and-fun-public-apis-to-inspire-your-next-project-7600ce3e9b3
- Or find your own API. Maybe your favorite hobby/site/game has a free API to use!

You can combine several API's in your application if you want to provide more value for your users.

You do not need to have a realistic monetization model, or take into account the problems of working with Intellectual Property. It would for example be ok√© to make some game with the Open Star Wars API, without having the licenses for it.
You are also allowed to "hand wave" an integration with a payment integrator, you can just provide a "purchase" button that when clicked adds some virtual currency (for a game), allows access to a pay wall area, ...

### Pitch perfect
At the end of monday (16:00 o'clock) each group will give a small [elevator pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch) (5 minutes) for the other groups. Make them excited for the end product!

### Let's split the work
On monday afternoon sit together and split your concept up into several technical stories. Estimate as a group how long each item will take. I advise using [planning poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker) for these estimations.
There are several free Planning Poker apps you could use.

After you have your stories write them all down on a post-it with their estimation and put them on the wall.

You have to choose a piece of wall to make a SCRUM board with post-its and with at least the following statuses (you can add more):

- Todo
- In progress
- Done

Make sure your wall is always up to date!

### Do a stand up meeting twice a day
Every morning and after the watch you need to do a stand up meeting and discuss the priorities of that day.

Vote the first time for a SCRUM master to lead those meetings. The SCRUM masters will have a short meeting with the coach and the other SCRUM masters after the first stand up each morning to discuss problems their group has and think together for solutions.

#### Some tips for a productive stand up meeting
* The SCRUM master is responsible for keeping everybody on track and the discussion flowing
* Each learner joins this meeting!
* This does not exceed 15 minutes
* What has been done since the last meeting, What is to be done before the next Scrum meeting is discussed during these meetings
* Blockers, Bottlenecks, dependencies if any are brought to the notice in these meetings.

### Feature freeze
the day before the deadlie 15:30 AM is __feature freeze__ time: you cannot add any new functionality at this point.

These are the things that you still can do:

- Improve the text on your website
- Improve the readme / presentation
- Fix bugs

The reason for this feature freeze is to focus on stabilising your product and not to introduce any new bugs. Respect this period!

### Presentation
The last day, 13:30 PM every group will make a presentation (around 15-20 minutes) about their start up. 
Each member needs to speak during the presentation.

- A general concept and live demo
- Discuss the hardest problem your group had and how you solved it
