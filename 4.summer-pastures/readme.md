# Welcome to the summer pastures

![Welcome to summer!](summer.jpg)

During your summer pastures we will provide you with several large projects to practice your new coding super powers.

All these projects have some shared commonalities:

- All of them are language independent. You are free, and even encouraged, to try other programming languages and frameworks you want to explore to complete all the challenges.
Want to try Laravel or Symfony? Go ahead? What about react for the frontend? Or even go wild, and use django and python for the backend layer.
  Your coach does strongly recommend to find other people in the group that want to explore the same technology, having peers that are going trough the same journey will greatly help your learning progress.
    
- The projects are designed to have both strong backend and frontend requirements. It would be wise to team up with your classmates that have chosen a different specialisation then you, so you can learn from each other and have both areas covered.

- Because of the large scope of the projects it is recommended to spend the first day planning. Use your knowledge of Scrum, and divide the work up in smaller user stories. It might also be a great idea to make a database schema together.
